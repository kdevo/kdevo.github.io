In my work, I analyzed how well the Ethereum Blockchain can be integrated into exisiting business processes of the FH Aachen. As a business process execution engine, I used the Open-Source Camunda BPM and wrote an own web3-connector.
If you like the thesis, please consider a â˜• donation to my Ethereum address:</description></item><item><title>Kai Dinghofer</title><link>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/kd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 22:25:16 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/kd/</guid><description>&amp;hellip; besides being an open-minded developer, I am also a regular human!
I like to travel, take photos and crusing with my skateboard(s) whenever it is possible. Other hobbies include (but are not limited to) running, hiking and of course: diving &amp;ndash; since 2018, I am SSI certified.
While I love communicating and intuitively connecting with people, it is an equal important part of me having the possibility to relax my mind exploring the world's wonderful nature.</description></item></channel></rss>
