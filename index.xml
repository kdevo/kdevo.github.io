I like to travel, take photos and crusing with my skateboard(s) whenever it is possible. Other hobbies include (but are not limited to) running, hiking and of course: diving.
While I love communicating and intuitively connecting with people, it is an equal important part of me having the possibility to relax my mind exploring the world&amp;rsquo;s wonderful nature.</description></item><item><title>Bachelor Thesis</title><link>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/bachelor-thesis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 22:25:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/bachelor-thesis/</guid><description>About one year after my Bachelor graduation, I asked myself: Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t other people have the possibility to read my thesis?
In my work, I analyzed how well the Ethereum Blockchain can be integrated into exisiting business processes of the FH Aachen. As a business process execution engine, I used the Open-Source Camunda BPM and wrote an own web3-connector to communicate with self-developed Smart Contracts.

I engineered Chaos, a first of its kind framework that aims to build a solid bridge between the research and development departments of RRSs.</description></item><item><title>Open Argon</title><link>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/open-argon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:48:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/open-argon/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Grapresso</title><link>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/grapresso/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 13:14:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/grapresso/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Osprey Delight</title><link>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/osprey-delight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 22:37:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/osprey-delight/</guid><description>{github-description}</description></item><item><title>Hugo Community Mods</title><link>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/hugo-mods/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 23:12:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kdevo.github.io/gallery/hugo-mods/</guid><description>A GitHub organization dedicated to High-Quality Hugo modules, some of them include:

By the start of 2021, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished my M.Eng. in Information Systems Engineering at the FH Aachen, where I took a deep dive into the emerging field of Reciprocal Recommender Systems from a research and practical point of view. Bringing these two views together, you can now read my published thesis or experiment with Chaos, a first of its kind framework for researching human-to-human recommendations.</description></item></channel></rss>
